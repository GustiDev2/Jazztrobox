  **FAQ**  
    Q: Where is the jukebox located?  
    A: It is located in the spawnmenu under entities/Jazztrobox
    
   Q: Does this addon work on multiplayer?  
   A: As of Ver 2. I think It should work, but there are downsides to it, mainly the sound is a tad bit quieter,
   and the song change/stop sound just nukes all sound there is in the game, so it might sound weird.
   if you don't like this change, you could download the old version from my old github, and importing it yourself to GMod.
   
   Q: Does this addon support multiple Jukeboxes?  
   A: As of Ver 2. If you try playing from a second jukebox while the first is playing, it will stop the sound from the first one
   and jumps to the second. Sorry!
   
   Q: I found a bug, what should i do?  
   A: Firstly, if you found a bug, look at the known bugs to see if the bug has been reported, if not Create an issue with an appropriate title  
   and write the bug and, if you can how to recreate the bug
   
   Q: May I edit this addon and upload it?  ex: An edit with different songs?  
   A: Do whatever you like with it, no need to credit anybody, same goes with the old version of my Addon.
   
   Q:Why different Repo?   
      A:Forgot old password...
   
   Q: This Addon Still Sucks  
   A: :(
   
   **Known Bugs**  
    Sometimes the song wont play when i click it   
   It does do that once in a while, just click on the song again and it should play.   

Nuclear Stop sounds   
It Just does that, I tried to find a workaround, but to no avail. I'll try fixing it sometime :p

Jukebox Too heavy and instakills people
